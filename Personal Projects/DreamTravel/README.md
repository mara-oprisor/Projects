# Dream Travel
## Description
For this project, I have created a Desktop Application which allows the user to book a room, leave a review and see all reviews. I implemented it using Java Swing and it is connected to a PostgreSQL database using a JDBC connection. The project uses an MVC pattern, the parts of the project being clearly divided.
